"""Schelling segregation simulator with rule-tree utility functions.

Each agent uses a rule tree (built from 6 primitive factors) to compute its
utility at any candidate location. At each step, every agent considers a
random vacant cell and moves there if its rule-tree utility is higher than
the utility at its current location.

This is the simulator backbone for Option D. Parameters match Gunaratne
et al. (2023, JASSS) where applicable:
  - Grid: 50 x 50, torus boundary, Moore neighborhood
  - Density: 0.95
  - Agents: 50/50 of two types
  - Ticks: 500
  - Movement: random vacancy, move if utility there > current

Simplifications versus the paper:
  - No per-agent threshold (the rule tree is the only decision criterion)
  - No random "happy" relocation (m = 0)

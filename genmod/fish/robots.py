"""Load the robot trajectories: a physical system with known programmed rules.

The Lei et al. (2020) release also contains trajectories of five CUBOID ROBOTS,
each executing one of the same neighbor-selection strategies in a larger arena.
These are not simulation output. They are real hardware: real actuation error,
real sensing delay, real collisions. But the generating rule is still known
exactly, because each robot was programmed with it.

That makes them the right test of the framework's actual claim. A rule library
learned entirely in simulation is only useful if it identifies mechanisms in a
system that was not simulated.

The domain shift is substantial, and worth stating precisely rather than
hand-waving at:

    property                simulated agents      robots
    arena radius            0.25 m                0.42 m   (1.7x)
    median kick interval    0.434 s               0.840 s  (1.9x slower)
    events per run          ~1600                 140-730
    rules present           11                    10

The missing rule is most-influential-k3, which has no robot file. The
classifier still has eleven outputs, so it can emit a class that cannot occur:
an extra way to be wrong, which we do not correct for.

Normalizing positions by the arena radius maps both arenas onto the unit disk,
which is the only reason a transfer is meaningful at all. Everything else --
the timescale, the noise, the physical dynamics -- is genuinely different, and
that is the point.

    """Re-express features from one domain's clock in another's.

    Positions are already normalized by arena radius, so every LENGTH in the
    feature vector is dimensionless (arena radii). TIME is not. The features
    carry three time-dependent quantities:

        speed, vx, vy   arena radii per SECOND
        ax, ay          arena radii per SECOND squared
        dt              SECONDS

    Robots kick 1.9x more slowly than the simulated agents. A robot moving
    identically -- the same fraction of the arena per kick -- therefore registers
    roughly half the speed in radii-per-second. The network would see a
    different animal purely because of the clock, and would be right to be
    confused.

    The physically correct move is to nondimensionalize: adopt each domain's own
    characteristic kick interval tau as its unit of time. Then

        speed * tau     = arena radii traversed PER KICK   (dimensionless)
        accel * tau^2                                      (dimensionless)
        dt / tau                                           (dimensionless, median 1)

    Expressing robot features in agent-equivalent units means multiplying
    velocities by tau_src/tau_dst, accelerations by its square, and dividing dt
    by it. Everything else -- distances, angles, polarization -- is already
    dimensionless and must be left alone.

    This retrains nothing. It corrects the units the data is expressed in
    BEFORE it reaches a network that was fitted in the other unit system.
